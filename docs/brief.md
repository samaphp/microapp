# MicroApp Project Brief

## Executive Summary

MicroApp is a minimal PHP 7.4+ microframework designed for building super-microservices with clean routing and zero external dependencies. This lightweight framework prioritizes simplicity, control, and long-term maintainability, making it ideal for developers who need to rapidly bootstrap tiny APIs, internal tools, or focused endpoints without the overhead of traditional frameworks.

## Project Overview

**Product Name:** MicroApp
**Version:** Pre-1.0.0 (Stable for production use)
**License:** MIT
**Package:** samaphp/microapp
**PHP Requirements:** 7.4+ with ext-json

### Core Philosophy

MicroApp is built on the principle that microservices should remain minimal, focused, and maintainable for decades without requiring major refactors or framework upgrades. The framework intentionally excludes features outside its core responsibility as a router, ensuring it stays lightweight, dependency-free, and easy to reason about.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Microservice Developers**: Building focused, single-purpose APIs and services
- **Startup Teams**: Needing rapid prototyping and deployment capabilities
- **Enterprise Developers**: Creating internal tools and focused backend services
- **Freelance Developers**: Delivering small, maintainable client projects

### Use Cases
- **RESTful APIs**: Fast development of JSON-based web services
- **Internal Tools**: Quick creation of company-specific utilities and dashboards
- **Microservices**: Building components for larger distributed systems
- **Webhooks**: Handling external service integrations and callbacks
- **Focused Endpoints**: Single-purpose services with clear boundaries

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Routing System
- **HTTP Methods**: Full support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH
- **Named Parameters**: Dynamic routing with type-safe parameters (e.g., `/user/{id:int}`)
- **Base Path Support**: Subdirectory deployment capabilities
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatic route loading from controller classes

#### 2. Middleware Architecture
- **Global Middleware**: Before/after hooks for all routes
- **Route-Specific Middleware**: Per-route middleware configuration
- **Middleware Registry**: Named middleware system for reusability
- **Flexible Execution**: Support for class-based and closure middleware

#### 3. Service Container
- **Explicit Registration**: Manual service registration for clarity
- **Dependency Injection**: Simple service sharing across controllers and middleware
- **Type Safety**: Runtime service validation and error handling

#### 4. Request/Response Handling
- **Input Sanitization**: Built-in filtering for GET, POST, JSON, and HEADER data
- **JSON Responses**: Dedicated JSON response helper with status codes
- **Header Management**: Request header retrieval and response header setting
- **Error Handling**: Centralized exception handling with debug support

### Key Technical Features

#### Zero Dependencies
- No external Composer packages required
- Only PHP 7.4+ and ext-json as system requirements
- Reduced security vulnerabilities and maintenance overhead

#### PSR-4 Autoloading
- Standard PHP autoloading implementation
- Clean namespace organization
- Composer integration for package distribution

#### Controller Auto-Discovery
- Automatic route loading from specified directories
- Convention-based controller structure
- Modular route organization

#### Extensibility
- Framework class extension for custom behavior
- Hook-based architecture for customization
- Service injection for shared functionality

## Competitive Analysis

### Advantages Over Traditional Frameworks
- **Performance**: No framework overhead or unnecessary features
- **Simplicity**: Single-file core implementation
- **Control**: Full control over application behavior
- **Maintenance**: Reduced long-term maintenance burden

### Advantages Over Other Microframeworks
- **Zero Dependencies**: Truly dependency-free architecture
- **Middleware System**: More flexible than basic routing
- **Service Container**: Explicit service management
- **Type Safety**: Parameter validation and filtering

## Market Positioning

MicroApp occupies a unique position in the PHP ecosystem as a truly minimal microframework that prioritizes long-term maintainability over feature completeness. It targets developers who value simplicity and control over convenience and automation.

### Ideal Scenarios
- Projects expected to run for 5-10+ years without major refactors
- Teams with strong PHP expertise who prefer explicit over implicit
- Organizations with strict security requirements
- Performance-critical microservices

### Less Suitable Scenarios
- Complex web applications requiring full MVC architecture
- Teams new to PHP development
- Projects requiring extensive built-in features
- Rapid prototyping where development speed is the primary concern

## Development Roadmap

### Near-Term (0.x Releases)
- PHP 8+ compatibility verification
- Enhanced middleware chaining capabilities
- Route grouping and prefixing features
- Lazy route registration for improved performance

### Medium-Term Considerations
- SQLite support for lightweight persistence
- File upload handling utilities
- PSR-15 middleware compatibility
- Route caching for production optimization

### Long-Term Vision
- Maintain zero-dependency philosophy
- Focus on stability and backward compatibility
- Gradual performance improvements
- Enhanced developer tooling

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Low**: Dependency management (none to manage)
- **Low**: Security vulnerabilities (minimal attack surface)
- **Medium**: Feature creep (must resist adding non-core functionality)
- **Low**: Performance issues (lightweight by design)

### Business Risks
- **Low**: Vendor lock-in (open source, MIT license)
- **Low**: Community adoption (growing microservice trend)
- **Medium**: Competition from established frameworks
- **Low**: Maintenance burden (simple, focused codebase)

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- Composer package downloads
- GitHub stars and forks
- Community contributions
- Production deployments

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage percentage
- Bug resolution time
- Documentation completeness
- User satisfaction feedback

## Conclusion

MicroApp represents a return to simplicity in PHP development, offering a focused, maintainable solution for microservice development. By intentionally limiting scope and maintaining zero dependencies, it provides a stable foundation for long-term projects while offering the flexibility needed for modern web development.

The framework's emphasis on clarity, control, and future-proof design makes it an excellent choice for organizations and developers who prioritize maintainability and stability over feature richness and rapid development capabilities.
